# Web CGI Exploits
Here's several exploits related to different web CGIs. I developed those last few years.


## How it works
Web app are basicly those layers:

1. applications
2. web frameworks       
3. script language engines
4. web containers(servers)
5. web front proxy(nginx etc.)

* `4` and `5` could be the same thing.

There are communications between each layer. each layer software are developed by different teams. they do have standards to communicate each other, but they always have misunderstandings or design faults. So we can take advantage of those faults to achieve our goals, like RCE, spwan a shell, port forward etc.
